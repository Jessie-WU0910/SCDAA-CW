Exercise 1.2
We can use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the error. MSE is a common metric, which can be calculated by averaging the squared differences between simulated results from the value function and some baseline or expected value. Since squaring the error has the effect of heavily penalizing larger errors. MSE is typically preferred in contexts involving quadratic cost functions or when the Gaussian noise model is assumed since it corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimator under such conditions.
